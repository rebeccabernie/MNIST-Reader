# Problem Sheet 2 - MNIST Reader

## Overview

This problem sheet relates to the [MNIST Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits. This repository **does not** include copies of the .gz files contained in the database, but these can be downloaded from the MNIST [website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The compressed image files contain images not in a standard format (like PNG or JPEG), meaning they cannot be viewed without first being converted to a one of these formats.
The training set and test set contain 60,000 and 10,000 examples, respectively. This program uses both sets.
